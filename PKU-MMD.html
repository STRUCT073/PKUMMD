			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<div class="desp">
				<p style="text-align:justify">
				PKU-MMD is a new large scale benchmark for continuous multi-modality
 3D human action understanding and covers a wide range of complex human 
activities with well annotated information. PKU-MMD contains 2 phases, 
for action detection tasks with increasing difficulty. Phase 1 is 
large-margin action detection task. Phase 2 is small-margin action 
detection task. Our dataset also provides multi-modality data sources, 
including RGB, depth, Infrared Radiation and Skeleton. We believe this 
large-scale dataset will benefit future researches on action detection 
for the community.

			<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
			<div class="desp">
				PKU-MMD is our new large-scale dataset focusing on long continuous 
sequences action detection and multi-modality action analysis. The 
dataset is captured via the Kinect v2 sensor. <br><br>

				<b>Phase #1</b> contains 1076 long video sequences in 51 action 
categories, performed by 66 subjects in three camera views. It contains 
almost 20,000 action instances and 5.4 million frames in total. Each 
video lasts about 3$\sim$4 minutes (recording ratio set to 30 FPS) and 
contains approximately 20 action instances. The total scale of our 
dataset is 5,312,580 frames of 3,000 minutes with 21,545 temporally 
localized actions. <br>

				We choose 51 action classes in total, which are divided into two 
parts: 41 daily actions (drinking, waving hand, putting on the glassed, <i>etc.</i>) and 10 interaction actions (hugging, shaking hands, <i>etc.</i>).
 66 distinct subjects are invited for our data collection. Each subjects
 takes part in 4 daily action videos and 2 interactive action videos.our
 videos only contain one part of the actions, either daily actions or 
interaction actions. We design 54 sequences and divide subjects into 9 
groups, and each groups randomly choose 6 sequences to perform. <br><br>

				<b>Phase #2</b> contains 1009 short video sequences in 41 action 
categories, performed by 13 subjects in three camera views.  Each video 
lasts about 1$\sim$2 minutes (recording ratio set to 30 FPS) and 
contains approximately 7 action instances.<br><br>

				We provide 5 categories of resources: depth maps, RGB images, skeleton joints, infrared sequences, and RGB videos. 
				<li>Depth maps are sequences of two dimensional depth values in millimeters. The resolution is $512\times424$.</li>
				<li>Joint information consists of 3-dimensional locations of 25 
major body joints for detected and tracked human bodies in the scene. We
 further provide the confidence of each joints point as appendix. </li>
				<li>RGB videos are recorded in the provided resolution of $1920\times1080$.</li>
				<li>Infrared sequences are also collected and stored frame by frame in $512\times424$.</li>

			<h2>Data Format</h2>
			<div class="format">
			<p> Video Files:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			RGB files are compressed to avi videos in 30 FPS using ffmpeg. File 
name format is $XXXX-V.avi$ for No. $XXXX$ video file in view $V$. For 
example $0001-L.avi$ is the first video in left view.</p>
			<p> Skeleton Files: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			For each video, there exists a skeleton file $XXXX-V.skeleton$ which 
contains several lines for frame-level skeleton data. Each line contains
 $3\times 25\times 2$ float numbers for 3-dimensional locations of 25 
major body joints of 2 subjects.
			</p>

			<p> Label Files:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			For each video, there exists a label file named $XXXX-V.label$ 
illustrating the ground truth labels. Several lines will be given, each 
line contains 4 integers for $Label, start, end, confidence$ 
respectively. Note that $confidence$ is either $1$ or $2$ for slight and
 strong recommendation respectively.</p>
			
			<p> Depth Files:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			 A folder is provided for each video which contains several images 
corresponding to each frame. Each image is in $two-dimensional$ 
$512\times 424$ png format.</p>

			<p> RGB Files:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			 A folder is provided for each video which contains several images 
corresponding to each frame. Each image is in $three-dimensional$ 
$1920\times 1080$ jpeg format.</p>

			<p> Infrared Files:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			 A folder is provided for each video which contains several images 
corresponding to each frame. Each image is in $one-dimensional$ 
$512\times 424$ png format.</p>

			<h2>Metrics</h2>			
			<div class="desp">
				<p>For the detection task, there is a basic criterion to evaluate 
the overlapping ratio between the predicted action interval $I$ and the 
ground truth interval $I^{*}$ with a threshold $\theta$. The detection 
interval is correct when
				\begin{equation}
			\frac{|I \cap I^{*}|}{|I \cup I^{*}|} &gt; \theta.
			\end{equation}
			where $I \cap I^{*}$ denotes the intersection of the predicted and 
ground truth intervals and $I \cup I^{*}$ denotes their union. So, with 
$\theta$, the precision $p(\theta)$ and recall $r(\theta)$ can be 
calculated.
			</p>

			<li><b>F1-Score</b>: With the above criterion to determine a correction detection, the F1-score is defined as
\begin{equation}
\mbox{F1}(\theta)=2 \cdot \frac{p(\theta) \times r(\theta)}{p(\theta) + r(\theta)}.
\end{equation}</li>

			<li><b>Interpolated Average Precision (AP)</b>: With confidence 
changing, precision and recall values can be plotted to give a 
precision-recall curve. Note that $r$ is also determined by overlapping 
confidence $\theta$. The interpolated average precision is calculated by
 the arithmetic mean of the interpolated precision at each recall level.
			\begin{equation}
			\mbox{AP} = \int_{0}^{1} \max_{r' \ge r} p(r') \; \mathrm{d}r.
			\label{APFORM}
			\end{equation}
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>Mean Average Precision of Actions (mAP$_a$)</b>: AP is used as
 the metric for evaluating the results on each activity category. The AP
 is averaged over all the activity categories. 
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>Mean Average Precision of Videos (mAP$_v$)</b>: AP is used as the metric for evaluating the results on each video. The AP is averaged over all the videos. 
			</li><br>
			<b>P.S.</b> For more information on Interpolated Average Precision, please read: <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-ranked-retrieval-results-1.html">Evaluation of ranked retrieval results</a>.

		<h2>FAQs</h2>
		<div>
		<li><strong>How can I obtain the coordinates of human skeletal joints on the RGB frames ? </strong>:
			<br>
			We did not record the coordinates of skeletons in the RGB in our dataset. But they can be calculated with the camera paramter matrix $M$.
			<br>
			M = [ <br>
	         	[1.03e3,     0,                 9.80e2], <br>
	         	[0,             1.03e3,         5.50e2], <br>
	         	[0,                0,                 1     ]  <br>
	      		]
	        <br>
			For a skeleton coordinate $p = [x,y,z]^T$ in the provided data, we can get the corresponding coordinate $p' = [x',y']^T$ in the RGB image by,

			$[a,b,c]^T = Mp$ <br>
			$x' = a/c$ <br>
			$y' = b/c$ <br>
